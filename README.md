# bank-assignment
This was my third assignment in the Programming III module. The purpose of it was to introduce the ideas of serialization and RandomAccessFile. I used NetBeans 8.2 to code it.

The original assignment instructions asked us to serialize to files ending in `.txt`. However, since these are binary files, before uploading to GitHub I changed the file endings to `.bin`.
